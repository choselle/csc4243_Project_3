### Project Declaration ###

* Authors: Nicholas Thibodeaux, Chase Hoselle, Chad Jarreau, Greg Patrick
* Project: LSU Intramurals
* Version 1.0
* Repository: https://bitbucket.org/gpatrick136/cs4243-lsu-intramurals
* Class Instructor: B.Ullmer


### Project Specification ###

Prototype and implement a demonstration user interface to communicate something relating to LSU, in ways aligned with our considerations in Assignment 1.

* Your interface should include at least two discrete and two continuous interaction elements; and at least two elements of complementary media (image, video, sound, etc.).
* Your interface should be prototyped and implemented with interaction driven by TouchOSC on an Apple iOS (iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad) or Android device (or simulator); and display upon a 2x1, 2x2, 1x2, or 3x2 tiled display.


### Project: LSU Intramurals ###

This repository will be used for the maintenance and development of our second group project for CS4243 Interface Design & Technology. We will be developing (in Java) the interface for an application that will serve UREC users and provide them with up-to-date information and services regarding the UREC's intramural sports competition.

Our application will incorporate two displays in order to meet the project's presentation specifications. The top screen will incorporate a static view that will update as actions are performed within the application.

The second display will run through the different stages of the application. This will include the following:

* Firstly, the user will instructed to log into the application by providing the LSU username/PAWS ID and password.
* By logging in the user will be taken to their intramural profile page. From here, the user can perform a number of actions using the interface's toolbar. These will include:
* Post roster vacancies in the intramurals system.
* Find free agents to add to their team.
* Find teams looking for extra players.
